# Rabbitmq Forge - Features and Validation Tests

## Introduction

So you've turned to Blacksmith once again to deploy your precious managed service. This time around messaging is the need and rabbitmq is the tool of choice. The following lines will walk you through the changes you need to introduce on blacksmith's deployment manifest to deploy rabbitmq, the features available of the deployed rabbitmq service, and different ways to test them, providing you at the same time, a clear path in troubleshooting your deployment in the future.

## Prerequisites

### External Bosh

Blacksmith used to exist all by itself, firing up its own bosh director to deploy and manage the service instances. This was introducing another resource to be managed and maintained, while adding little if anything to the service broker's usability. Given the detached status between blacksmith's director, and the director hosting most if not all of the resources using its services, it was hindering interconnectivity between the blacksmith's deployed services and the ones available to bosh director hosting our cloudfoundry deployment. That said, a decision has been made to use `- external-bosh` as the default feature in deploying blacksmith. This is expecting `blacksmith_user` and `blacksmith_password` under `secret/exodus/dev/bosh` (where dev is the environment name) with credentials to the bosh director.

### Cloudfoundry

Rabbitmq forge has gone a long way since its first introduction. A lot of changes and features where added with the most prominent one being autoscaling based on rabbitmq's queue depth. Given its dependencies, when `rabbitmq-autoscale` feature and plans are added to blacksmith, it is expecting a cloudfoundry deployment with the `- app-autoscaler-integration` feature enabled.


## Deploying rabbitmq

As in all genesis kits, all you need to do is to provide the corresponding configuration lines on the deployment manifest. Bellow is an example of said manifest

```yaml
kit:
  name:    dev
  version: latest
  features:
    - external-bosh
    - rabbitmq
    - rabbitmq-tls  
    - rabbitmq-dual-mode
    - rabbitmq-dashboard-registration ## Needs cf
    - rabbitmq-autoscale ## Needs cf-app-autoscaler

A successful deployment of the above blacksmith manifest (or a variation of, that matches your choices) should be followed by the registration of the broker using the addon `genesis do envname register`. Once blacksmith has been registered, cf will report the available plans provided earlier:

`cf marketplace`

```
Getting all service offerings from marketplace in org system / space dev as admin...

offering   plans                                                          description                                         broker
rabbitmq   large-single-node, large-three-node, single-node, three-node   A dedicated RabbitMQ instance, deployed on-demand   dev-blacksmith

TIP: Use 'cf marketplace -e SERVICE_OFFERING' to view descriptions of individual plans of a given service offering.
```

and as per the tip, a slightly more verbose version:

`cf marketplace -e rabbitmq`

```java
Getting service plan information for service offering rabbitmq in org system / space dev as admin...

broker: dev-blacksmith
   plan                description                     free or paid   costs
   large-single-node   Large dedicated RabbitMQ node
   free           
   large-three-node    3-node RabbitMQ cluster
         free           
   single-node         Small dedicated RabbitMQ node
   free           
   three-node          3-node RabbitMQ cluster
         free           
```

## Creating the service instances

With blacksmith deployed, registered and the services available at your disposal through cf's marketplace, you are ready to start deploying the service instances with their corresponding plans. For completeness, we will deploy all available plans:

`cf create-service rabbitmq single-node rmqsmall`

```
Creating service instance rmqsmall in org system / space dev as admin...

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service rmqsmall' to check operation status.
OK
```

`cf create-service rabbitmq large-single-node rmqlarge`

```
Creating service instance rmqlarge in org system / space dev as admin...

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service rmqlarge' to check operation status.
OK
```

`cf create-service rabbitmq three-node rmqclustersmall`

```
Creating service instance rmqclustersmall in org system / space dev as admin...

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service rmqclustersmall' to check operation status.
OK
```

`cf create-service rabbitmq large-three-node rmqclusterlarge`

```
Creating service instance rmqclusterlarge in org system / space dev as admin...

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service rmqclusterlarge' to check operation status.
OK
```

By the time you get yourself a fresh cup of coffee (5 minutes in our testing environment), the following services should be available through cf

`cf services`

```
Getting service instances in org system / space dev as admin...

name              offering   plan                bound apps   last operation     broker           upgrade available

rmqlarge          rabbitmq   large-single-node                create succeeded   dev-blacksmith   no
rmqsmall          rabbitmq   single-node                      create succeeded   dev-blacksmith   no
```

## <a name="binding"></a>Binding the service

As much as everyone would like to have (all the) services available to them at all times, its when using them that makes a difference. To use rabbitmq you need to bind it to an application. For the requirements of this document, lets go ahead and clone a forked version of [cf-rabbitmq-example-app](https://github.com/itsouvalas/cf-rabbitmq-example-app):

`git clone https://github.com/itsouvalas/cf-rabbitmq-example-app`

`cd cf-rabbitmq-example-app`

`cf push`

```
Pushing app rabbitmq to org system / space dev as admin...
...
start command:   bundle exec rackup config.ru -p $PORT
     state     since                  cpu    memory          disk          logging      details
#0   running   2022-10-20T12:44:17Z   0.2%   34.3M of 256M   91.4M of 1G   0/s of 0/s   
```

With the application available we are ready to bind it to the deployed service:

`cf bind-service rabbitmq rmqsmall`

```
Binding service instance rmqsmall to app rabbitmq in org system / space dev as admin...
OK

TIP: Use 'cf restage rabbitmq' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
```

As per the tip, lets go ahead and restage the application:

`cf restage rabbitmq`

```
This action will cause app downtime.

Restaging app rabbitmq in org system / space dev as admin...

```

We are now ready to run our tests and verify that the service and its features are available to the application.

# <a name="testing"></a>Rabbitmq Testing

We saw that everything went fine so far, but unless we take that in good faith we can't really confirm that the application and the service is working as expected. Given that `good faith` is rarely something we rely on, lets go ahead and see for ourselves:

## Successful binding

[cf-rabbitmq-example-app](https://github.com/itsouvalas/cf-rabbitmq-example-app) has an endpoint to test exactly that. As per the readme:


`export APP=https://rabbitmq.run.codex2.starkandwayne.com`

`curl $APP/ping -k`

```
OK
```

But, running this application and using this endpoint is not a requirement to check a successful binding. If you have your application deployed already, you can ssh to the application and confirm the values for VCAP_SERVICES:

`cf ssh rabbitmq`

```
vcap@9e804020-4fd4-4207-5343-cbc1:~$
```

`env`

```json

## <a name="service-key"></a>Service key creation

Blacksmith uses the same `bind` function to bind the credentials seen earlier to a service key to be used outside that specific application:

`cf create-service-key rmqsmall rmqappuser`

```
Creating service key rmqappuser for service instance rmqsmall as admin...
OK
```

we may then confirm the same `VCAP_SERVICES` contents under the service key:

`cf service-key rmqsmall rmqappuser`

We've confirmed the binding and the creation of the service key, but we have yet to see queues being created and messages beings posted and consumed. Let's go ahead and use the same application for a confirmation:

* Export the APP url (if not done already)

`export APP=https://rabbitmq.run.codex2.starkandwayne.com`

* Create a `dummy_queue`

`curl -X POST $APP/queues -d 'name=dummy_queue' -k`

```
SUCCESS
```

* List the available queues

`curl -X GET $APP/queues -k`

```

```

* Say "hello"

`curl -X PUT $APP/queue/dummy_queue -d 'data=Hello' -k`

```
SUCCESS
```

* and receive the message
`curl -X GET $APP/queue/dummy_queue -k`

```
Hello
```

## <a name="permissions"></a>Permissions

With everything working we know that we have enough privileges to reach out to the deployed service, but since seeing is believing lets go ahead and take a look:

* ssh to the rabbitmq deployed instance:

`cd blacksmith-deployments` # or to any genesis deployment directory

get a listing of the available vms

`genesis -A bosh dev vms` # replace with your environment name file

```

From the list of the available users, we can also see a user with the `monitoring` tag attached to it, which can also be found under `monitoring_username` of VCAP_SERVICES:

`rabbitmqctl list_user_permissions Q3rDM0aRKbCwaajmizfgRodj07RVLAK4tZggh650U9a7Lgo8XdESbUCZrvHRRUpb`

```

Finally, we also see a user attached to the `administrator` tag, though it hasn't been seen anywhere through the binding process:

```
Listing permissions for user "mlaZOgWgLdF3xIZhqJIdMBfkQZx6tcwvGaLtTPAMeATyGiP7MAXFpJrvRQzZNg7i" ...

```

This user is only available through blacksmiths UI, minimizing in that way the permissions available to the applications interacting with rabbitmq service. We will circle back on that on the monitoring section of this document.

## TLS connectivity and Certificate verification

The [forked](https://github.com/itsouvalas/cf-rabbitmq-example-app) version of the testing application has updated the way the `bunny` call is made against the rabbitmq service and updated the environment variables available to that call. In most testing scenarios, the **default** setting of non tls connectivity, or absense of the CA certificate verification would suffice given that those tests are run against a development environment usually lucking proper certificate placement. For TLS connectivity and CA verification read along:

### TLS Connectivity

* enable tls communication on the application through the corresponding environment variable

`cf set-env rabbitmq RABBITMQ_USE_TLS true`

```
Setting env variable RABBITMQ_USE_TLS for app rabbitmq in org system / space dev as admin...
OK

TIP: Use 'cf restage rabbitmq' to ensure your env variable changes take effect.
```

* restage application for the new environment variables to be picked up

`cf restage rabbitmq`

* repeat the [messaging](#messaging) steps above

### CA Certificate Verification

* enable CA verification on the application through the corresponding environment variable

`cf set-env rabbitmq RABBITMQ_CHECK_SSL true`

```
Setting env variable RABBITMQ_CHECK_SSL for app rabbitmq in org system / space dev as admin...
OK

TIP: Use 'cf restage rabbitmq' to ensure your env variable changes take effect.
```

* restage application for the new environment variables to be picked up

`cf restage rabbitmq`

* run the [messaging](#messaging) steps above one last time.


# Autoscaling based on queue depth

Autoscaling might be considered one of the main reasons for taking advantage of a cloud infrastructure. 
[cf-app-autoscaler-genesis-kit](https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-app-autoscaler-genesis-kit) uses [
app-autoscaler-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/app-autoscaler-release) to scale up based on a number of metrics or schedules. Blacksmith's rabbitmq forge has been extended with [rabbitmq-metrics-emitter-release](https://github.com/starkandwayne/rabbitmq-metrics-emitter-release) that uses the mechanics of app-autoscaler to scale your application based on the queue's depth as a metric.

## Prerequisites

As you might have guessed already, atuoscaling based on queue depth requires [cf-app-autoscaler-genesis-kit](https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-app-autoscaler-genesis-kit) to be deployed along your cf. It uses a number of secrets that are exported by the kit to communicate with loggregator, which then become actionable scaling events based on a policy defining the queue and the threshold for those events.

Assuming that your environment name is dev, once you have:

* deployed cf-app-autoscaler

`genesis deploy dev` # on cf-app-autoscaler-deployments directory

* registered the broker to your deployed cf

`genesis do dev bind-autoscaler`

* setup the the 'autoscaler' plugin to the cf cli

`genesis do dev setup-cf-plugin`

* and created the corresponding service

`cf create-service autoscaler autoscaler-free-plan autoscaler`

you should be able to see the service broker listed

`cf service-brokers`

```
Getting service brokers as admin...
name             url
dev-blacksmith   https://blacksmith.system.codex2.starkandwayne.com:443
autoscaler       https://autoscalerservicebroker.system.codex2.starkandwayne.com
```

and the recently created service as well

`cf services`

```
Getting service instances in org system / space dev as admin...

name         offering     plan                   bound apps   last operation     broker           upgrade available
autoscaler   autoscaler   autoscaler-free-plan                create succeeded   autoscaler       no
rmq-3        rabbitmq     three-node                          create succeeded   dev-blacksmith   no
rmqsmall     rabbitmq     single-node                         create succeeded   dev-blacksmith   no
```

You are now ready to create the autoscaling policy, bind it together to the autoscaling service and test scaling based on the queue's depth.

## Autoscaling policy

Autoscaling policies can be very intricate to cover your every need. In this case we will create the bare minimum to allow autoscaling based on queue depth. At the time of this writing, the metric collected is a combination of the `queue_name` (dynamic) separated by an underscore `_` from `messages_ready` (static). In the example below we scale up when `messages_ready` is greater than (>) one (1) and scale down when it is less than (<) two (2). We are also setting the minimum and maximum number of instances between one (1) and three (3) :

```json
{
    "instance_min_count": 1,
    "instance_max_count": 3,
    "scaling_rules": [
{
  "metric_type": "dummy_queue_messages_ready",
  "threshold": 1,
  "operator": ">",
  "adjustment": "+1"
},
{
  "metric_type": "dummy_queue_messages_ready",
  "threshold": 2,
  "operator": "<",
  "adjustment": "-1"
}
]
}
```

## Binding autoscaling policy based on queue depth

Assuming that you have named the above file as `test-policy.json` the following line will bind the application to the autoscaler service:

`cf bind-service rabbitmq autoscaler -c test-policy.json`

```
Binding service instance autoscaler to app rabbitmq in org system / space dev as admin...
OK

TIP: Use 'cf restage rabbitmq' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
```

# Autoscaling testing
Having successfully bound the application to the autoscaler service you are ready to push messages to the queue. Using the same application and `dummy_queue` defined above, we move onto adding messages to the queue

(Steps completed already)

`export APP=https://rabbitmq.run.codex2.starkandwayne.com`

`curl -X POST $APP/queues -d 'name=dummy_queue' -k`

`curl $APP/ping -k` 


* Send 3 `Hello` messages to the `dummy_queue`

`curl -X PUT $APP/queue/dummy_queue -d 'data=Hello' -k`
```
SUCCESS
```

* Make messages ready

Given that the messages reach rabbitmq in an unacknowledged state in this application, and taking into consideration that autoscaler is looking out for `messages_ready`, we need to either wait for 30 minutes or force them to become ready by restaging the application:

`cf restage rabbitmq`

* `watch` for scaling up events

`watch -c -n30 "cf autoscaling-history rabbitmq"`

```
Scaling Type            Status          Instance Changes        Time                            Action                                                                            Error     
dynamic                 succeeded       2->3                    2022-10-21T14:06:06Z            +1 instance(s) because dummy_queue_messages_ready > 1msgs for 120 seconds              
dynamic                 succeeded       1->2                    2022-10-21T14:00:06Z            +1 instance(s) because dummy_queue_messages_ready > 1msgs for 120 seconds 
```

* consume the messages

Given the application ia a testing one, when restaging it lost knowledge of the queue. Go ahead and re-create the queue, **multiple times** until you receive SUCCESS **for all the instances running** (i.e 3 SUCCESS for 3 instances). That way all of them are aware of the queue's name/existence.

`curl -X POST $APP/queues -d 'name=dummy_queue' -k`

```
SUCCESS
```

and then read the messages

`curl -X GET $APP/queue/dummy_queue -k`
```
Hello
Hello
Hello
```

* `watch` for scaling down events

`watch -c -n30 "cf autoscaling-history rabbitmq"`

```

# Monitoring/UI

We've seen already how we can do everything through `genesis` and `cf` cli. Our ability to monitor, or control the service for rabbitmq specifically doesn't stop here. Both blacksmith and rabbitmq provide us with a UI that we can either use to view our deployed services and their corresponding information, or to take action through rabbitmq's management interface.

## Blacksmith's UI

If you used the `fqdn` parameter above, you can access using the URL https://fqdn which in our example it translates to https://blacksmith.system.codex2.starkandwayne.com. Else, you can use the `ip` parameter which in this case translates to  https://10.7.16.8 . When visited, it will prompt you for a user name and password which can be found when running `genesis info dev` on your blacksmith's deployment directory

`genesis info dev`

Using the `dashboard_url` and by providing the `admin_password` and `admin_username` we are presented with the rabbitmq's management UI https://rabbitmq-three-node-a24f14f3-b191-4c04-b1bc-2edb845faca6.system.codex2

![Rabbitmq Management UI](assets/rabbitmq.png)

### Additonal infromation

* `- rabbitmq-dashboard-registration`

The `dashboard_url` url may provide either an IP or a dns based route registerd with cf. In order to provide the latter, a cloudfoundry deployment should be already present and the `- rabbitmq-dashboard-registration` feature should be selected on blacksmith's deployment manifest.

* `- rabbitmq-tls`

Communication to rabbitmq may be either done securely though 5671 and 15671 port for amqp and the managment interface or insecurely though 5672 and 15672 respectively. When `- rabbitmq-tls` frature is selected on blacksmith's deployment manifest the former will be true.

* `- rabbitmq-dual-mode`

With `- rabbitmq-tls` feature enabled you also have the option to anable `- rabbitmq-dual-mode` feature which will allow both protocols. A quick way to confirm which features are enabled, is to attempt to connect to any of the deployed rabbitmq instaces (the features are enabled deployment wide):

`cd blacksmith-deployments` # or to any genesis deployment directory

get a listing of the available vms

`genesis -A bosh dev vms` # replace with your environment name file

```

# Dynamic Credentials

Our past implementation of credentials handling relied on the creation of three types of users, admin, monitoring, and application, all of which were created during the creation of the service instance itself. The monitoring and application users were available to each application bound to the service instance or to each service key created against that service. Even though an application could be unbound from the Rabbitmq service or have the service key deleted, given the static nature of the credentials, those would still be able to communicate with RabbitMQ untill that service instance was deleted.

The dynamic credentials feature extends the predefined static credentials with new, unique credentials created each time an applicaiton is bound to the RabbitMQ service or a service key is created against that same service. As a result, operators can rely on the static credentials for monitoring, application testing and administering the RabbitMQ service while relying on dynamic credentials for each of the application bindings or service keys created.

## Creating dynamic credentials

The process is now embeded to the [Binding the service](#binding) and [Service key creation](#service-key) process defined earlier.

## Testing dynamic credentials

For generalized tests of the service, if you haven't done so already, you can go through the [Rabbitmq Testing](#testing) process.

## Confirming the dynamic nature of credentials

### Environment Variables

`cf env rabbitmq` # replace with the application name bound to rabbitm's service

Each of those , `bind` and `service-key` commands has created the corresponding key to rabbitmq's instance. ssh to the rabbitmq instance ( discussed on [permissions](#permissions) earlier ) and list the users:

`rabbitmqctl list_users`

```

```

Note the uuid based format for each of the users created earlier, `2e5552dd-94da-4768-aeca-ffb664ebce86` for the binding and `43eb6b37-dfa7-446d-9317-b4c2030cf777` for the service key

### Deleting the dynamic credentials

* unbind the application

`cf unbind-service rabbitmq rmqsmall`

```
Unbinding app rabbitmq from service rmqsmall in org system / space dev as admin...
OK
```

* delete the service key

`cf delete-service-key rmqsmall rmqappuser`

```
cf delete-service-key rmqsmall rmqappuser
Really delete the service key rmqappuser? [yN]: y
Deleting key rmqappuser for service instance rmqsmall as admin...
OK
```

### Confirming cleanup

Repeat the `list_users` command issued earlier on the rabbitmq instance

`rabbitmqctl list_users`

```
Listing users ...
user    tags

```

and confirm that the uuid based users are no longer present.

### Confirm uniqueness of dynamic credentials created

Both `cf bind` and `cf create-service-key` processes use the same "bind" function. This means to say that, the steps above have already demonstrated the fact that each binding, may that be done through binding the application to the service or creating a service key for the same service, will create a unique set of credentials each time. To reiterate on that, lets repeat the [Binding the service](#binding) steps above against two applications, and create two service bindings against the same service:

`cf bind-service rabbitmq rmqsmall`

```
Binding service instance rmqsmall to app rabbitmq in org system / space dev as admin...
OK

TIP: Use 'cf restage rabbitmq' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
```

`cf bind-service rabbitmq2 rmqsmall`

```
Binding service instance rmqsmall to app rabbitmq2 in org system / space dev as admin...
OK

TIP: Use 'cf restage rabbitmq2' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
```

`cf create-service-key rmqsmall rmqappuser`

```
Creating service key rmqappuser for service instance rmqsmall as admin...
OK
```

`cf create-service-key rmqsmall rmqappuser2`

```
Creating service key rmqappuser2 for service instance rmqsmall as admin...
OK
```

We have now created 4 bindings, two bindings against `rabbitmq` and `rabbitmq2` applications and two service key creations named `rmqappuser` and `rmqappuser2` respectively. Lets see what `cf` has to say about that:

`cf services`

```
Getting service instances in org system / space dev as admin...

name         offering     plan                   bound apps            last operation     broker           upgrade available
autoscaler   autoscaler   autoscaler-free-plan                         create succeeded   autoscaler       no
rmqsmall     rabbitmq     single-node            rabbitmq, rabbitmq2   create succeeded   dev-blacksmith   no
```

`cf service-keys rmqsmall`

```
Getting keys for service instance rmqsmall as admin...

name          last operation     message
rmqappuser    create succeeded   
rmqappuser2   create succeeded   
```

Now, lets have a look at the users listed under the rabbitmq instance:

`rabbitmqctl list_users`

```

KFACZ4BbYbrUt4xfbch5YtDjovNIzbLprNHHH9erIOeuVKnD9sxzOJG6XU9rJj66        [administrator]
```

Finally lets compare that output from the environmnent variables for the bound applications and the service keys to see the users in place:

`cf env rabbitmq | grep username | tail -1`

```
"username": "7078785d-723e-4441-88b4-41e03817cadc",
```

`cf env rabbitmq2 | grep username | tail -1`

```
"username": "b916a74f-44cc-480f-b4a2-64f098c72631",
```

`cf service-key rmqsmall rmqappuser | grep username | tail -1`

```
"username": "07bbbed0-b846-47e6-8798-599c5abebe38",
```

`cf service-key rmqsmall rmqappuser2 | grep username | tail -1`

```
"username": "93c654fb-5041-4e59-a0c2-cec620add265",
```


## Conclusion

If everything went as planned and assuming that you followed along, by the time your reach these lines you have managed to 
* deploy rabbitm's forge through blacksmith's genesis kit, 
* create and bind rabbitmq service to a testing application, 
* test connectivity, queue creation as well as message creation and consumption
* create and bind an autoscaling policy to the test application
* test autoscaling based on rabbitm's quees depth.
* test the presence and uniqueness of the dynamic credentials created
* had fun during the process!

Finally, you also saw a bit under the hood which will give you a head start in the (hopefully unlikely) event of having to troubleshoot your deployment. Happy messaging!
