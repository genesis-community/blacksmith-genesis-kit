# Blacksmith Genesis Kit Manual

The **Blacksmith Genesis Kit** deploys a Blacksmith On-Demand
Services Broker for Cloud Foundry.  Blacksmith uses BOSH to deploy
new data services instances on behalf of end users.

# Base Parameters

- `ip` - The static IP address to deploy the Blacksmith broker
  to.  This must exist within the static range of the `network`.

- `shareable` - When registering the service broker, advertise the
  services as shareable or not.

## Sizing and Deployment Parameters

- `network` - The name of the `network` (per cloud-config) where
  the blacksmith broker will be deployed.  Defaults to `blacksmith`.

- `stemcell_os` - The operating system you want to deploy the
  Blacksmith service broker itself on.  This defaults to
  `ubuntu-xenial`.

- `stemcell_version` - The version of the stemcell to deploy.
  Defaults to `97.latest`, which is usually what you want, since
  this kit uses precompiled BOSH director releases that only work
  on the 97.x ubuntu-xenial series.

- `vm_type` - The name of the `vm_type` (per cloud-config) that
  will be used to deploy the blacksmith broker VM.  Defaults to
  `blacksmith`.

- `disk_size` - How big of a data disk to provide the Blacksmith
  broker, for persistent storage.  Defaults to `20480` (20G).

## Blacksmith Broker Parameters

- `blacksmith_debug` - Whether or not to enable Blacksmith
  debug logging.  Defaults to `false`, but you can set it to
  `true` if you really like log output.

- `blacksmith_port` - The TCP port that Blacksmith will bind to
  This defaults to `3000`.

- `blacksmith_tls_port` - The TCP port that Blacksmith will bind to for tls traffic
  This defaults to `443`.

- `blacksmith_tls_certificate` - The certificate blacksmith should present for
  https traffic on the webui and api.

- `blacksmith_tls_key` - The corresponding key for the above certificate.

- `blacksmith_env` - An identifying string that will be used to
  differentiate Blacksmith brokers in their management UIs.
  Defaults to empty, but you probably want to set this.

### Blacksmith (Internal) BOSH Director Parameters

- `cloud_config` - A YAML chunk that defines an entire BOSH v2
  cloud-config that Blacksmith will deploy to its internal BOSH
  director.

- `releases` - A list of releases that Blacksmith should upload
  to its internal BOSH director, for use by service deployments.
  Each entry must include `name`, `version`, `url` and `sha1`
  keys.  Most of the time, the Forge manifests will set these
  themselves, but sometimes you need to do your own thing.

- `stemcells` - A list of stemcells that Blacksmith should
  upload to its internal BOSH director, for use by service
  deployments.  You will almost always have to specify these,
  since Forge manifests will rarely be in a position to anticipate
  your IaaS choices.

## HTTP(S) Proxy Parameters

- `http_proxy` - (Optional) URL of an HTTP proxy to use for any
  outbound HTTP (non-TLS) communication.

- `https_proxy` - (Optional) URL of an HTTP proxy to use for any
  outbound HTTPS (TLS) communication.

- `no_proxy` - A list of IPs, FQDNs, partial domains, etc. to
  skip the proxy and connect to directly.  This has no effect if
  the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` are not set.

# Features

- `vsphere` (IaaS) - Deploy the on-demand services to a VMWare
  vSphere hypervisor cluster.  You will need to provide all of the
  information Blacksmith needs to contact the vCenter API for VM
  orchestration purposes.

  Activating this feature also activates the following parameters:

  - `vsphere_ip` - The IP address of your vCenter (VCSA) server
    that manages the vSphere environment to deploy to.

    names where the Blacksmith BOSH director will store persistent
    (data) disks.

  - `vsphere_datacenter` - The name of the vSphere data center
    where Blacksmith will deploy things.  The clusters listed in
    `vsphere_clusters` must exist within this data center.

  - `vsphere_clusters` - A YAML list of vSphere cluster names
    where Blacksmith will deploy service VMs.

  existing bosh director.  You will need to provide all of the information
  Blacksmith needs to contact bosh director for deployments orchestration

    provide them explicitly.

  - `postgresql_service_limit` - An upper limit on the number of
    service instances _total_ that can be provisioned, regardless
    of per-plan limits.  `0` (the default) imposes no global

# Cloud Configuration

By default, Blacksmith uses the following VM types/networks/disk
pools from your cloud config. Feel free to override them in your
environment, if you would rather they use entities already
existing in your cloud config:

```
params:
  network:   blacksmith
  vm_type:   blacksmith
```

# Available Addons

- `visit` - Opens the Blacksmith Web Management Console in your
  browser.  This only works on macOS.

  This web interface provides an at-a-glance summary of all the
  salient bits of the Blacksmith broker deployment, the service
  catalog, quotas, and deployed service instances.

  This interface is protected by HTTP basic authentication, and
  this addon takes that into account, without bothering you.

- `register` - Register this Blacksmith Broker with a Cloud
  Foundry instance (deployed by Genesis).  Optionally takes the
  name of the CF environment to register with.

  If the service broker is already registered, this will run
  update-service-broker instead.

- `bosh` - Sets up a local alias for the Blacksmith (Internal)
  BOSH director, retrieves the X.509 CA Certificate and BOSH admin
  credentials, and authenticates to it.

  After this runs, you will be able to use the BOSH CLI, unaided,
  to interact with the Blacksmith BOSH director, for
  troubleshooting and diagnostics.

- `boss` - Runs `boss`, a command-line utility for interacting
  directly with Blacksmith via the Open Service Broker API,
  without needing a Cloud Foundry instance.

  This requires that you have `boss` already installed.  You can
  get `boss` from https://github.com/jhunt/boss/releases

- `curl` - Run arbitrary HTTP requests against the Blacksmith
  Broker and its API.  This is very useful for troubleshooting
  weird Blacksmith issues.  The `/b/status` and `/b/catalog`
  endpoints are useful.

# Examples

Deploying Blacksmith with a vSphere director:

```
---
kit:
  name:    blacksmith
  version: 5.6.7
  features:
    - vsphere

params:
  env: acme-us-east-1-prod

  ip: 10.0.134.4

  shareable: true

  # vSphere
  vsphere_ip:         10.0.0.254
  vsphere_datacenter: prod-esx-01
  vsphere_clusters:
    - cf1

  vsphere_ephemeral_datastores:
    - vol20
    - vol21
    - vol22
    - vol23

  vsphere_persistent_datastores:
    - san1
    - san3
```

Since Blacksmith has its own internal BOSH director, you need to
supply a cloud configuration, and stemcells.  Here's an example:

```
  cloud_config:
    azs:
      - name: z1
        cloud_properties:
          datacenters:
            - name: prod-esx-01
              clusters:
                - cf1: {}

    networks:
      - name: services
        type: manual
        subnets:
          - range: 10.254.0.0/16
            gateway: 10.254.0.1
            az: z1
            cloud_properties:
              name: VMNetwork

    vm_types:
      - name: small
        cloud_properties:
          cpu:  2
          ram:  2_048
          disk: 8_192

      - name: medium
        cloud_properties:
          cpu:   4
          ram:   8_192
          disk: 32_768

    compilation:
      workers: 3
      reuse_compilation_vms: true
      az: z1
      vm_type: small
      network: services
```

Example PostgreSQL service offering plans:

```
  postgresql_plans:
    standalone:
      type:    standalone
      vm_type: small
      network: services
      disk:    8_192
      limit:   10

    small-cluster:
      type:    cluster
      vm_type: medium
      network: services
      disk:    8_192
      limit:   3
```

# History

Version 0.2.0 was the first version to support Genesis 2.6 hooks
for addon scripts and `genesis info`.
